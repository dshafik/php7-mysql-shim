# PHP 7 Shim for ext/mysql

This library attempts to create a drop-in replacement for ext/mysql on PHP 7 using mysqli.

For the most part, it should _just work_, although you either need to prefix all calls with a `\` (only internal functions will fallback to the global scope)
or import the functions into every file (e.g. `use function \mysql_connect`).

## Installation

To install, either add `dshafik/php7-mysql-shim` to your `composer.json`:

```sh
$ composer require dshafik/php7-mysql-shim
```

or, clone/download this repo, and include `mysql.php` in your project.

## Usage

Once the file is included, it will create `mysql_*` function if they don't already exist.

## Caveats

- Calls to `is_resource()` and `get_resource_type()` on MySQL connections and results will fail as these are now their `mysqli` equivalents.
-Some errors are now from `ext/mysqli`, and others are `E_USER_WARNING` instead of `E_WARNING`.
- Column lengths reported by `mysql_field_len()` assume latin1
- If no host, username, password parameter is provided when using the `mysql_*` functions, the default values from the corresponding mysqli settings from php.ini file will be used
(e.g. mysqli.default_host, mysqli.default_user, mysqli.default_pw)
